# DuckHunt

https://howdidigithere.github.io/DuckHunt/

## Background
A throwback to the 1980's NES. This is a simple game with a clear objective, shoot the ducks before they fly away, but make sure not to miss! You only have three shots every round.

## Functionality & MVPs
In Duck Hunt, users will be able to:
- Click on the ducks.
- Every round you have 10 seconds to click on all the ducks.
- Every duck clicked awards points.
- If you miss some or all of your shots or the 10 seconds ends the ducks fly off and the round is over.
- If all ducks are clicked before the timer is over you get bonus points.

In addition, this project will include:
- Animations for the ducks flying and the iconic laughing dog.
- Instruction on how to play the game.
- A README.md file.
